# Certification Authority k8s

A set of containers and YAML files for creating and managing a personal CA in K8s.

## `containers` folder

In the containers folder there is all the material to build the containers to be run in K8s.
This should not be important to the end user, since the containers are automatically built at every commit, and published on docker hub.
